## Write-up

As the hint says, the Java integer is defined as being 4 bytes long, meaning
there are 2^32-1 possible numbers. Let's try messing with the server
```
$ nc vuln2014.picoctf.com 50000
Your number is 4041368. Can you make it negative by adding a positive integer?
123412341234
I'm unable to parse your number. It might be too large (the largest java int is
2147483647), or just not a number.
```

Well this is interesting. 2147483647 is less than 2^32, or 4294967296. As a
matter of fact, it's almost half. The reason for this is a system called [Two's
Complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). This system is
how our computers interpret negative numbers. The important thing to know is
that anything greater than 2147483647 in the four byte integer will be
interpreted by Java as negative, meaning we can get a flag!
```
 nc vuln2014.picoctf.com 50000
Your number is 8644681. Can you make it negative by adding a positive integer?
2147483647
Congratulations! The sum is -2138838968. Here is the flag: That_was_easssy!

Thanks for playing.
